# Serene Image Storage Implementation

This document explains the image storage implementation in the Serene application.

## Overview

Instead of embedding large base64-encoded images directly in Markdown, the application now:

1. Saves images to the filesystem
2. Serves them via a dedicated API endpoint
3. References them in Markdown using standard image tags with API URLs

## Implementation Details

### Backend Components

1. **Image Storage Service** (`app/services/image_storage.py`)
   - Handles saving image data to the filesystem
   - Generates unique filenames
   - Provides utilities for path resolution

2. **Images API Endpoint** (`app/api/endpoints/images.py`)
   - Serves stored images via the `/api/images/{filename}` route
   - Handles proper content types
   - Returns 404 for missing images

3. **Document Processing** (`app/api/endpoints/process.py`)
   - Updated to save base64 images to the filesystem
   - Replaces base64 data in Markdown with API URLs
   - Preserves image associations with the right alt text

### Frontend Components

1. **Document Viewer** (`components/ui/document-viewer.tsx`)
   - Enhanced to handle API image URLs
   - Special styling for different image types
   - Improved error handling for images

2. **CSS Styles** (`app/globals.css`)
   - Added styles for API-served images
   - Special styling for certificate images
   - Loading states and error handling

## Benefits

1. **Performance**
   - Dramatically reduced initial page load size
   - Browser caching of images
   - Progressive loading of images

2. **Reliability**
   - No data URL size limitations
   - No CSP (Content Security Policy) issues
   - No browser memory constraints with large images

3. **Better User Experience**
   - Faster rendering
   - Smoother scrolling
   - Improved image display quality

## Testing

You can test the implementation with the provided `test_image_service.py` script:

```bash
python test_image_service.py
```

This will:
1. Generate a test image
2. Save it to the filesystem
3. Create a test Markdown file referencing the image via the API

## API Endpoint

Images are served from:

```
/api/images/{filename}
```

Where `{filename}` is the unique identifier generated when the image was saved.

## Future Improvements

1. **Image Optimization**
   - Resize large images for better performance
   - Convert to WebP or other efficient formats
   - Automatic cropping of unnecessary whitespace

2. **Storage Options**
   - Support for cloud storage (S3, etc.)
   - CDN integration for faster delivery
   - Cleanup of unused images

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Access control for images
   - Rate limiting
   - Expiring URLs for sensitive documents
